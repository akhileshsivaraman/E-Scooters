# E-Scooters

A Tidy Tuesday-like task I completed as part of a data science job interview demonstrating:

* wrangling and data validation
* exploratory data analysis 
* descriptive statistics
* data viz
* time series analysis (including the application of an ARIMA model)

I used R Markdown for the analysis and to produce a presentation (ioslides).
